    Can UH Community College student use the Warrior Recreation Center?<br/>

For summer membership, they must either be 1) enrolled in summer school and have their <br/>community college ID validated for summer or 2) registered for the Fall semester that follows that particular summer. Community college students must go<br/> to the Ticket & Information Office to purchase their WRC memberships, as well as a WRC Membership Card. (The cost of a WRC Membership Card is $10)<br/>



    Can UH System Faculty/Staff use the Warrior Recreation Center?<br/>
    UH System Faculty/Staff membership starts for as little as $240 annually. Unfortunately, monthly automatic payments are not available and membership is not<br/> considered a pre-tax benefit.



    Can other affiliates of UH Manoa use the Warrior Recreation Center?<br/>
    Yes, please see the Membership tab on the left for a list of affiliates and membership options. If one does not have a UH Manoa student or Faculty/Staff ID, <br/>then a WRC Membership card can be purchased at the Ticket & Information Office (located in Campus Center). The cost of a WRC Membership Card is $10.<br/>



    Can guests of students and Warrior Recreation Center members use the Warrior Recreation Center?<br/>
    Yes, guests may purchase a buddy pass at the front desk for the day for $10 or for the week for $20. Buddy passes are limited to one guest per sponsor <br/>(student/member). After purchasing a buddy pass, guest must present a photo ID to verify identity and must be accompanied by sponsor at all times.<br/>



    How do I rent a locker or purchase additional services?<br/>
    Lockers and additional services can be rented at a first come, first serve basis at the Front Desk Service Counter in the Warrior Recreation Center. In <br/>order to purchase towel (shower towel) and/or laundry service, a locker rental must first be purchased. See below for price listings. Free daily use <br/>lockers are also available inside and outside of the locker rooms. The Warrior Recreation Center is not responsible for any lost or stolen objects.<br/>



    Do students need to pay for locker rentals, towel service, and laundry service as well?<br/>
    Students will need to pay for all three of these services. Prices will be the same for all member categories.<br/>



    Do UH Manoa students need to purchase an additional membership?<br/>
    No, UH Manoa students who pay the "MAN Studnt Ctr Ops & Rec Fee" for the respective semester have membership for the Warrior Recreation Center and its <br/>auxiliary facilities included as part of the fee. If students are NOT enrolled or paying the rec fee for the respective semester, then additional <br/>membership must be purchased.



    How can I check if I paid the fee?<br/>

    1. Log-in to your MyUH Portal<br/>

    2. Click on "View Charges/Make a Payment" on the left-hand column<br/>

    3. Click on "View my Account for Each Term"<br/>

    4. Look for the listed "MAN Studnt Ctr Ops & Rec Fee"<br/>



    If I have a membership to enter the Warrior Recreation Center, will I still need to pay the auxiliary fee if I want access to the tennis courts and pool too?<br/>
    Purchasing the WRC membership automatically grants you access to the auxiliary facilities down at lower campus. The auxiliary fee was created for patrons <br/>who do not want to purchase a Warrior Recreation Center membership but still intend to use the lower campus facilities.



    My UH Manoa ID does not scan correctly at the front turnstiles, what do I do?<br/>
    Please see the Ticket & Information Office at Campus Center to re-encode IDs. IDs may have an encoding error in the magnetic strip. If an ID appears to be <br/>damaged, a new ID must be purchased.



    How can I participate in the Warrior Recreation Center Fitness Classes?<br/>
    Classes are held in the multi-purpose room in the WRC on a first come, first serve basis. Prior to the start of a class, an announcement may be made on the<br/> intercom. To see available classes please look at the Class Description tab on the left.<br/>



    Do you have the schedule of Fitness Classes available online?<br/>
    Class schedules are tentative and subject to change due to instructor availability. An email sign up sheet is located at the Front Desk at the Warrior <br/>Recreation Center. After providing an email address with the Front Desk, we can share a weekly class schedule with you.<br/>



    How will I know when my locker or other services expire?<br/>
    One week before expiration a notification email will be sent reminding you of your expiring locker and or service(s).<br/>
